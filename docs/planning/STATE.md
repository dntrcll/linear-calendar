## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Rebuild Metrics vs Fix RLS: Metrics feature was underutilized and health-only; rebuilding with auto-calculated productivity metrics + manual health tracking provides more value
- Dense layout over spacious: User explicitly wants more info visible without scrolling; matches power-user tool aesthetic
- Manual + Auto hybrid in Metrics: Combines best of both: manual health tracking for data app can't infer, auto-calculated productivity from existing timeline events
- Keep existing tech stack: App is working well with React + MUI + Supabase; no need to introduce new frameworks

### Pending Todos
