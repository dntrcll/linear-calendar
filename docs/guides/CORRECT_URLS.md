## For Google Cloud Console OAuth Setup

Copy these exact URLs into your Google Cloud Console:

### App Information
- **App name:** Timeline.OS
- **Application home page:** `https://timeline.solutions`
- **App logo:** Use the logo from `export-logo.html` (512×512 or 1024×1024)

### Legal Pages
- **Privacy Policy:** `https://timeline.solutions/privacy`
- **Terms of Service:** `https://timeline.solutions/terms`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Wrong URL:** `https://linear-calendar.vercel.app`
   - This is NOT your app (it's someone else's Russian calendar)
   - Do NOT use this URL

2. **Correct URL:** `https://timeline.solutions`
   - This is YOUR Timeline.OS deployment
   - Use this everywhere

3. **Verify in Vercel:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Find your Timeline.OS project
   - Confirm the production URL matches `timeline.solutions`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Use these URLs in Google Cloud Console
2. ✅ Test your OAuth flow at `https://timeline.solutions`
3. ✅ Verify Privacy/Terms pages load correctly
4. ✅ Upload your logo (from `export-logo.html`)

All changes have been pushed to GitHub and will auto-deploy to Vercel!
